	http://code.google.com/p/serpantin/downloads/list
	or checkout the development version from svn
	svn checkout http://serpantin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ serpantin

3. Create your customized local_settings.py file::
	cp local_settings-customize.py local_settings.py

4.  Edit this local_settings.py file for your setup. The following values need to be changed::
	DATABASE_ENGINE = 'Your DB Engine Here'
	DATABASE_NAME = 'Your DB Name Here'
	DATABASE_PASSWORD = 'Your DB Password Here'
	DATABASE_USER = 'Your DB User Here'
	SECRET_KEY = 'Your secret key here'

	DOJO_DIR = 'The directory where you installed Dojo here'

5. Populate the database with Serpantin tables and load fixtures::
	python manage.py syncdb

6. Start up the sample webserver::
	python manage.py runserver

7. Point your browser to::
	http://localhost:8000/

8. If you want to see the admin interface, point your browser to::
	http://localhost/admin

.. note::
    The above urls will be dependent on your Django setup. If you're running the webserver on the
    same machine you're developing on, the above urls should work. If not, use the appropriate url.
