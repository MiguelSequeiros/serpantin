sERPantin is kind of ERP application for small enterprises.

In its current state (offsite) it works more than a year as CRM and billing application
in small service company and continuosly grows upon the needs.

Before first public release we'd like to do the following changes:
- switch to Dojo 0.9 (current codebase is using Dojo 0.4.3)
- switch to Django's newforms
- make a lot of cleansiness
- missed something?

Current trunk is almost empty but we expect to fill it "real soon"  as we have fully
functional prototype to start with...
